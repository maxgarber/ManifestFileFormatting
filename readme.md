# Manifest File Format and Tools

A simple way of organizing and automating lists of things to do programmatically like installs, configs, etc.

## Manifest File Format

Below is an example manifest

```
#<manifest> @title:"Homebrew install set" @version:"0.0.1" @author:"Max Garber"

nmap        # network tool
jq          # for working with JSON files via CLI
noti        # send desktop notifications via CLI
openssl
kotlin
idris
ffmpeg
fdupes
exiftool
node
npm
tree        # for seeing whole file hierarchies
wget
xz
```

## Usage

The standard use is to interpret each line as a single argument to be passed to a command, e.g. `brew install` with everything from the # to the end of line ignored as a comment.

Conversely, if a list of items is generated by some process, it could be captured as a new manifest file, e.g. from `brew list`.

## Toolset

**`manifest`**:&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepts as its first argument a manifest file, and all subsequent arguments are the command to which each entity in the manifest is passed *note*: this does not yet support passing the entity in a position-specific manner, only as the last piece of text on the invocation line.

**`...`**
